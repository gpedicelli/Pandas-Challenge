Looking at the tables, I've come to the conclusion that smaller schools have overall higher test averages. This could be due to the fact that the schools are able to provide more resources, and the teachers can spend more time working with the students. 

Another observation from the data is that charter schools have higher average and percent passing scores. One possible reason for this is that it's probably easier for charter schools to get money for newer technology and recources than it is for district schools. When district schools need more money, they have to jump through a lot of hoops and put issuses on local ballots to be voted on. 





## Instructions

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

**Hint:** Check out a [sample solution](PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb) to review the desired format for this assignment.

### District Summary

Create a high-level snapshot, in a DataFrame, of the district's key metrics, including the following:

* Total schools
* Total students
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### School Summary

Create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school, including the following:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Create a DataFrame that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Create a DataFrame that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Math Scores by Grade

Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). Use your judgment to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending. Include the following metrics in the table:

* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Scores by School Size

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
### Scores by School Type

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on type of school (district or charter).

### Submission
On [Bootcamp Spot](https://bootcampspot-v2.com), submit a link to the `pandas-challenge` repo that you created for this assignment. Be sure to include a `README.md` file in addition to the Jupyter Notebook that contains your report.
